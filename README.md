### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**sarmitamajumdar/sarmitamajumdar** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a self-directed  Diabetic Retinopathy project(Dr.SMit), using public data from Kaggle.  This is informative as well as assistive to diabetic / non-diabetic patients to detect whether they have retinopathy problems or not.  This will open up a window to diagnose or start treatment.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning further about Deep Neural Network models.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m eager to work with mentors in a team.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Data Science topics related to my work.
